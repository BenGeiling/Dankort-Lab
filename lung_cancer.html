			<p>Genetically engineered mice are presently the gold standard for whole organism cancer modeling. While, existing and emerging technologies afford researchers the ability to query fundamental questions regarding the genetics of tumor initiation, progression, maintenance and ultimately, malignancy. Cancer arises due to the sequential acquisition of genetic and epigenetic “hits” in a stepwise fashion. These "hits" are most often associated with deregulation in two classes of genes: oncogenes and tumour suppressor.</p>
			<p>RAS and BRAF are the two most prevalent mutated oncogenes found in human cancers, particularly in lung cancer (~30%) and melanoma (~85%) where they function in the classical Ras-activated Raf-Mek-Erk kinase pathway. Additionally, there is a constellation of tumour suppressor loss in these cancers particularly losses in p53, PTEN, and INK4&alpha;/ARF. Despite the enumeration of genetic lesions from human cancer data, there is a lack of understanding of how these oncogenes and tumour suppressors contribute in the evolution of malignancy. For instance, aberrant activation of the Ras-activated Raf-Mek-Erk pathway in primary cells paradoxically induces a sustained cell cycle arrest (senescence), suggesting additional genes cooperate to permit tumour formation and/or progression. Armed with the vast array of genetic and molecular tools afforded to those who work with the mouse as a model organism, the Dankort lab seeks to: define these cooperating genes and how they function, establish when they are important in the evolution of a tumour and to determine the proper cell to target for destruction within a tumor. The results of these findings will be important for the understanding of aberrant cell control and tumour progression and will inform the development of rational therapeutic strategies to treat effectively cancer.</p>

(A) PCR detection of BRaf<sup>CA</sup> rearrangement from lungs of BRaf<sup>+/+</sup> (wt) or BRaf<sup>CA/+</sup> mice infected with Ad-βGal (B) or Ad-Cre (C). The black arrowhead, blue arrow, and red arrowhead highlight the wild-type, the unrearranged BRaf<sup>CA</sup>, and the BRaf<sup>VE</sup> alleles, respectively. (B) Detection of BRaf<sup>VE</sup> mRNA in BRaf<sup>CA</sup> mice following Ad-Cre infection. Total lung RNA from BRaf<sup>+/+</sup> (wt) or BRaf<sup>CA/+</sup> mice isolated 8 wk after Ad-Cre infection (5 × 107 PFU) was subjected to RT–PCR analysis. BRaf<sup>CA</sup> and BRaf<sup>VE</sup> transcripts are distinguished through the use of restriction polymorphisms (BamHI, B; XbaI, X) with the diagnostic digestion products indicated by blue arrows and red arrowheads, respectively. (C–L) BRaf<sup>CA/+</sup> mice were infected with 5 × 107 PFU (C–H) or 106 PFU (I–L) of Ad-Cre intranasally and were analyzed 7 wk following infection. (C) Macroscopic lesions are present on the surface of BRaf<sup>CA/+</sup> (right and magnified in D) but not wild-type (left) lungs. (E–H) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histological sections of wild-type (E,F) or BRaf<sup>CA/+</sup> (G,H). Note papillary adenomas in higher power magnification (H) and wide-scale involvement of lungs (G). (I,J) Adenomas stain negative for CCA (I,J) and positive for SP-C (K,L). Bars: F,H,J,L, 100 μm; E,G,I,K, 500 μm.</p></div>
