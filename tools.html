				<div id="research_heading"><h1>The pLEG/pREG Modular Viral Vector System</h1></div>
				<p>The LEG (Lentiviral Expression Gateway) system is a flexible vector system that allows the rapid production of lentiviral and retroviral (REG) vectors that express cDNAs with or without inhibitory RNAs (shRNAmirs) using Gateway technology. This modular system consists of a vector backbone, a cDNA contained in a standard ENTRY vector, genetic markers or florescent proteins are encoded downstream of internal ribosome entry sequences and are flanked by attR2 and attL3 sites contained in a pBEG vector, and, an optional miR30-embedded shRNA flanked by attR3 and att L4 sites.  These modules are combined using a multisite Gateway LR reaction with a destination vector.  Destination vectors can be either a pLEX-based lentiviral vector (pLEG R1-R3 or pLEG R1-R4) or a pQCxix-based retroviral expression vector (pREG R1-R3 or pREG R1-R4). Each vector contains a self-inactivating 3â€™ LTR.</p>
				<p>The configuration allows the cDNA, genetic marker or florescent protein and miRNA to be cloned while maintaining precise order, spacing and orientation into either a lentiviral or retroviral destination vector. cDNAs may be maintained in pEntry vectors (attL1 and attL2) and the same plasmids used for multiple LR reactions to rapidly produce a large number of viral expression vectors with variations in selectable marker or miRNA expression (conversely the cDNA could be varied) without the need to characterize each plasmid. Novel miRNAs may be generated and triaged efficiently using a pCheck (attR1 and attR2) plasmid. To do this cDNA (from pEntry vectors) are cloned into pCheck R1-R2 behind Renilla luciferase by standard Gateway LR reaction and then targeted with a candidate shRNAmir.</p>
